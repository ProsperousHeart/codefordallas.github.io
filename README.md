# Code for Dallas Website

This is currently a work in progress (WIP).

Our volunteers are currently working on different sections independently. We are building the structure with HTML and CSS to ensure proper placement before finalizing text, specific images, colors, animations, etc.

Once the basic structure has been outlined, we will bring everything together into a single React app.

Color & animations to be done last, since we will need to optimize after integration.
